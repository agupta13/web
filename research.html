    <h2 align="left">Making the 'Net' Work!</h2>
    <p>
    <p>

        The proliferation of Internet-connected devices, services, and applications makes it
        more critical than ever to make sure that the network they depend on is reliable,
        performant, and secure. At the same time, their increasing complexity and diversity
        have made even simple network management tasks, such as debugging performance or
        detecting attacks, more complicated than ever. Modern network management needs to
        provide operators with better ways to: (1) monitor what is going on in their networks;
        (2) take real-time preventive or corrective actions based on this information,
        to improve reliability, performance, and security of the networks and the services
        that run on them. Achieving these goals given the limited compute and storage
        resources available on modern network devices is challenging.

        In my dissertation research, I developed two systems that address the challenges of
        better information gathering, and more flexible control, respectively. They are:

    <ul style="margin-left: 100px;">
        <li><b>Network Monitoring</b> (with <a href="http://sonata.cs.princeton.edu" ><b>Sonata</b> </a>),
            i.e., collecting and analysing the raw network data at scale to infer various
            activities of interest, such as DDoS attacks, or link failures, etc. in real-time; and</li>
        <li><b>Programmatic Control</b> (with <a href="http://sdx.cs.princeton.edu" > <b>SDX</b> </a>),
            i.e., applying the reactive fine-grained reactive control actions without
            disrupting Internet's routing protocols.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
        In both cases, my research focuses on:
        (1) the abstractions that allow operators to express flexible programs for monitoring and control;
        (2) the algorithms and data structures that make the best use of limited compute and storage resources;
        and (3) the systems that glue high-level abstractions to the low-level algorithms.

            To keep the networks running, network operators need to monitor a wide range of network
            activities. For example, they need to concurrently detect whether the network is
            under attack and also determine whether there is a device failure in the network.
            This involves extracting multiple features from the traffic data and combining
            them to infer activities of interest in real time. Most existing network monitoring
            systems are either not expressive, i.e., they support an insufficient
            set of monitoring tasks, or they are not scalable, i.e., they fail to scale as
            the traffic volume intensifies and the number of telemetry tasks increases.
            In contrast, to make the 'net' work, network operators require running multiple
            flexible monitoring queries over high-volume networks. My research focuses on
            building a distributed real-time network monitoring system that is both
            <em>flexible</em> and <em>scalable</em>.

            <p>
                After determining what events are going on in the network, network operators
                needs to apply reactive fine-grained control actions. My research focuses on
                applying programmatic control for the inter-domain networks settings, where by
                default networks use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange traffic with
                each other. In my study, I demonstrate that BGP is not suited for applying
                fine-grained control actions. Ideally, one would like to replace BGP with a
                clean-slate solution enabling network-wide programmatic control. However, the
                existing Internet-wide deployment of BGP-speaking routers makes such an approach
                impractical. Thus, the goal of my research was to design and implement an
                incrementally deployable solution that ensures maximal impact with minimal
                deployment overhead while safely interoperating with BGP.

                SDX has been a major

                software project with the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) since March 2016.
                The project website provides instructions for network operators to use software
                with both virtual and physical switches. It has been used by operators at large
                IXPs, such as <a href="https://github.com/h2020-endeavour/endeavour">
                <b>DE-CIX</b></a> and

                and is the de-facto SDX platform used by researchers affiliated with the Endeavour
                (Europe) and IX.BR (Brazil) projects. It was also used by developers, working
                on a project replacing conventional exchange, connecting multiple government
                agencies, with a software-defined exchange.  The software system has also been
                shipped with a commercial product,

                iSDX was also the basis for a programming assignment used by tens of thousands of
                students enrolled for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/sdn"> <b>SDN
